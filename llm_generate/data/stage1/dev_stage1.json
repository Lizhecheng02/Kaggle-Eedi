Writes the digit 3 times instead of cubing\n12. Has cubed the base number and the power\n13. Believes that when multiplying a number with a power, the multiplier is added onto the power\n14. When substiting into an algebraic term, raises the coefficient to the power of the variable rather than multiplying the coefficient and the variable..\n15. Believes  c, in y=mx+c, will be the y value of the coordinate given despite the x coordinate not being 0.\n16. Has added the powers rather than multiplying them\n17. Believes addition comes before indices, in orders of operation\n18. Multiplies by the index\n19. Does not understand laws of indices\n20. Does not know what a cube number is\n21. Repeats the digits three times when cubing a number\n22. Mixes up cubing and squaring\n23. Assumes they multiply by the numerator of fractional index\n24. Uses difference as index instead of coefficient in nth term rule\n25. Thinks that when raising a variable with a coefficient to a power, only the coefficient is affected by the power","597":"1. Rounds down instead of up\n2. Rounds incorrectly when the nearest 10 is a multiple of 100\n3. Rounds up instead of down\n4.

Does not understand which place value is the one that determines if a number rounds up or down\n15. Rounds the wrong way when interpreting a real-life context\n16. When rounding, believes that if the number, after the required degree of accuracy, is a 5 or below you round down\n17. Does not understand you can round to numbers other than powers of 10\n18. Rounds incorrectly by changing multiple place values\n19. Rounds to the nearest integer when estimating\n20. Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (rounds too little)\n21.
